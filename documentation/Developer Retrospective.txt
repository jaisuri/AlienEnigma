Developer Retrospective

What went well
- An excellent opportunity where I could demonstrate the OOP concepts learnt into the game
- Utilised the vectors and geometery concepts I learnt in Mathematics Specialist 
- Building on the Python concepts I learnt in Year 11
- Representing the project flow in system architecture and class diagram, gave a very good idea for the designing and development  
- Developing unit tests along side the program classess helped in making sure no regression bugs are introduced
- Use of mock and patch for unit testing 

Challenges faced
- Learning new program (Tiled) for generating the game world and the way paths
- Game crashes due to corrupted music file and game logic on handling index out error
- Leaning and use of mock and patch was challenging during unit testing as the implementation was difficult during development

Lessons learnt
- Learnt new programm (Tiled), which will help me create more maps if needed to extend the game with different layouts for different levels
- Extensive use of exception handling allowed me to identify and fix issues easily
- Along with manual testing and debugging, unit tests play an important role in the code quality and reducing the rework time
